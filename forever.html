        <h1>My Love,</h1>
        <p>thank you for saying yes again, love! grabe, sobrang saya ko right now. you don’t know how much this means to me. the moment na nag-message ka ng, ‘sayang wala ako sa pinas,’ I already felt something different. parang ang bilis lang ng lahat, pero at the same time, it feels so right. every conversation we had made me realize na ikaw talaga yung gusto ko. 💕</p>
        <p>alam kong ang bilis ng lahat, pero when it feels this real, bakit pa kailangan maghintay? love, I know LDR tayo, and hindi siya madali. pero para sayo, it’s so worth it. you’ve been so patient, so understanding, and so loving kahit may distance tayo. that’s why I know na ikaw talaga yung gusto kong makasama.</p>
        <p>every morning na kausap kita, every ‘I love you’ and ‘I miss you,’ it makes me feel so happy and alive. kahit malayo tayo, you make me feel so close. love, you’re one of the best things that’s ever happened to me, and I want to give you the love and care that you truly deserve.</p>
        <p>I’m so excited for the day na magkakasama tayo in person, but until then, I’ll hold on to the love we have right now.</p>
        <p>I promise na I’ll do my best to make it work. I’m so excited for the future, kahit na virtual lang muna tayo for now.</p>
        <p>we may be far from each other, but my heart is always with you. I love you so much, and I’ll always do my best to make you feel how special you are. thank you for trusting me, for loving me, and for being you. this is just the beginning of our forever. ❤️</p>
        <p>Yours always, <br>Monique L.</p>
